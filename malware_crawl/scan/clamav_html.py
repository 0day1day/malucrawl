        To be truly effective we need to determine what files might actually effect
        the rendering of the page and what files a user might be tricked into
        downloading.

        * JavaScript in <script> tags
        * Executable files

        Things we might not be interested in:
        * images
        * links to other domains (example.com and example.net differ, but www.example.com and example.com do not) that are pure HTML
        * CSS

        Also not we need to be careful with how much we download!

        We don't want to sit and download an 8GB DVD or even an unlimited byte radio
        stream!

        We also want to avoid downloading the same page twice (once to get the links
        then again to scan the page itself).
