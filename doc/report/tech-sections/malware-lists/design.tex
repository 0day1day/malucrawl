Malware lists scanners are a type of Zero Interaction Malware Scanner.

The scanners use a collection of URLs or domain names that are pre-generated and made available by other systems such as WOT, Alexa and the Google Safe Browsing APIs, this means that these scanners do not interact in any way with the target server that is being investigated, ie they do not download the page content. This is an advantage both because potentially less web requests have to be made and importantly the target server cannot detect this type of scan.


\subsubsection{Services}
Alexa is a service that maintains a list of domains ranked by traffic. This traffic rank is determined ``by analyzing the Web usage of millions of Alexa Toolbar users and data obtained from other, diverse traffic data sources.''\cite{alexa-about}. This list is available as a zipped CSV that is updated daily \cite{alexa-site-archive}.

WOT makes available a JSON API endpoint for querying a database of domains associated with values of ``Trustworthiness'', ``Vendor reliability'', ``Privacy'' and ``Child Safety''. These values are crowd sourced: ``Based on ratings from millions of web users and trusted technical sources''\cite{wot-about}.  The usage terms of the API is that it must only be called once every 10 minutes, and cannot make a duplicate request in any 30 minute interval.
