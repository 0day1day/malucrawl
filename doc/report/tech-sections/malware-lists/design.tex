\subsection{Design}
Malware lists scanners are a type of Zero Interaction Malware Scanner.

The scanners use a collection of URLs or domain names that are pre-generated and made available by other systems such as WOT, Alexa and the Google Safe Browsing APIs, this means that these scanners do not interact in any way with the target server that is being investigated, ie they do not download the page content. This is an advantage both because potentially less web requests have to be made and importantly the target server cannot detect this type of scan.


\subsubsection{Services}
Alexa is a service that maintains a list of domains ranked by traffic. This traffic rank is determined ``by analyzing the Web usage of millions of Alexa Toolbar users and data obtained from other, diverse traffic data sources.''\cite{alexa-about}. This list is available as a zipped CSV that is updated daily \cite{alexa-site-archive}.

To use the Alexa service the data in the the CSV must be made available, locally, to all of the worker nodes. A web request should not be made more than once per day to the Alexa service as this is a waste of bandwidth. As such a distributed database, with the ability to designate a master and many slaves must be used.

WOT makes available a JSON API endpoint for querying a database of domains associated with values of ``Trustworthiness'', ``Vendor reliability'', ``Privacy'' and ``Child Safety''. These values are crowd sourced: ``Based on ratings from millions of web users and trusted technical sources''\cite{wot-about}.  The usage limits of the API are as follows

\begin{itemize}
    \item The API must only be called once every 10 minutes.
    \item A request for the same domain must not be made in any 30 minute interval.
    \item The number of domains in the HTTP request must not exceed 100.
    \item The size of the URL of the HTTP request must not exceed 8KiB.
\end{itemize}

To prevent exceeding the usage limit, WOT tasks that access the database must be batched and results should be cached across the entire distributed system with a timeout of 30 minutes.
