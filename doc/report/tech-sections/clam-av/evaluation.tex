\subsection{Evaluation of ClamAV Malware Scan}
Anti-virus scanning empowers our system the ability to detect malicious 
signiture patterns in various file types that may exist in webpages. The 
testing results proved the fast response and scanning speed of ClamAV. The 
program returns an elegant list of malwares found in a particular website, and 
is self-contained. \\
However the design of this application is still far to be perfect. One of the 
defects could be the exclusion of links to other domains. It might be too 
decisive which is highly possible to miss malicious files.  For example it is 
not rare to see a webpage contains a direct download link which contains a
virus executable hosted on another website that cannot be easily found by 
search engine. Apart from disadvantages inherited from low interaction 
detection method, another point is that the system does not filter obvious 
harmless file types, such as images and videos. It can be better polished if 
the project schedule could be more relaxing.
