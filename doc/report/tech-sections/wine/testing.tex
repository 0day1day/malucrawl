\subsection{Testing}
After the first draft of implementation of the Wine Explorer, its functions are
tested individually before combine to a whole module for unit testing. This is a sample 
output from \verb'check_change' when comparing a modified Wine prefix with 
the clean one:
\begin{verbatim}
(['wineprefix_ie6', 'user.reg~'], 
['winetricks.log'], 
['user.reg'], 
[])
\end{verbatim}
Where each array in the record stores newly created files, removed files, 
modified files and files unable to check respectively. \\
By conclusion, all functions 
explained in the implementation section are ensured to work separately, 
however we do not have the time to search for websites that affect file 
systems. This program will be further polished when we produce a demo 
of the whole project in the future.
