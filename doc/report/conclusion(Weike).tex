\subsection{Wine Explorer and ClamAV scanner}
Wine Explorer provides a lightweight solution for high interaction malware 
detection. It has advantages over virtual machines and emulators including 
short reset time, fast execution and RAM/disk saving, where the potential 
security threat blocks its way to perfection. The program is also approved to 
execute stably, for instance the correctness of the Wine prefix package is 
guaranteed via hash check which avoids external modifications of it. We 
explained the lacking of complete detection as well, which could be 
implemented if we have more time in this project.

We also provide a signiture-based malware scanning powered by ClamAV. The 
HTML crawler in the same program gives links for ClamAV to scan and an 
overall list of malicious links in a webpage can be produced from the 
application. It has fast scanning and executes concurrently which rises 
the system's throughput to a significant amount where disadvantages exists 
such as unprecise link filtering. An improvement could be a deeper level of 
website crawling, and better link processing which requires further amount 
of time to complete.
