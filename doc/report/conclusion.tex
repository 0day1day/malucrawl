\subsection{Capture-HPC}

Capture-HPC is a high interaction client honeypot, a system designed to actively
search for malware by rendering the content at provided URLs. The system is
capable of returning detailed results, and although slow provides a very
accurate simulation of a user browsing with a poorly secured browser and OS.
Capture-HPC integrates easily into the framework using a mysql database to drive
it, although a fair amount of customisation was needed for Capture-HPC to work
in the ECS VM and network infrastructure with additional issues caused by the
security architecture used. Capture-HPC however remains to be a very useful
malware scanner as part of the framework, with further work possible within the
framework to optimise the URLs passed to Capture-HPC so only the most suspicious
URLs are processed.
