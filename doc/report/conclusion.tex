\subsection{Capture-HPC}




Capture-HPC is a high interaction client honeypot, a system designed to actively
search for malware by rendering the content at provided URLs. In addition to
offering a accurate simulation of a user browsing the web Capture-HPC provide
much flexibility, capable of automatically rendering content using a variety of
client programs including web browsers such as Internet Explorer and Firefox,
and the PDF viewer Adobe Reader. It also allows a degree of freedom in choosing
the sensitivity of the malware detection using the exclusion lists, a feature
that also makes the process of porting Capture-HPC to other Windows OSs
considerably simpler.

Capture-HPC was found to be fairly slow, justifiable by the amount of work that
must happen to render the content in a real web browser. The issue of speed
meant that Capture-HPC has been integrated into the framework with some care,
restricting the number of URLs passed to it via classification to attempt to
limit the execution time for a set of URLs. Despite this Capture-HPC still 
remains one of the more powerful malware scanners available in the framework.
