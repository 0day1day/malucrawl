\subsection{Capture-HPC}

Although Capture-HPC is a very capable malware scanning component, there were
numerous difficulties involved setting it up. Compiling the Windows kernel
drivers for the client was a very complex process, but will need to be repeated
to generate installers for other Windows OSs. The ECS specific modifications
that needed two sets of RPC over Message Queues to work also caused considerable
delay to the integration of Capture-HPC into the framework, but means that some
level of network security is maintained separating the hosts running the rest of
the framework from the host running Capture-HPC.

\subsection{Malware Lists}
Although a very fast in terms on URLs scanned per second, the components of the system using Malware Lists give very limited results about those URLs. This is not a severe problem as the intention of these components is to avoid scanning high traffic, or high trustworthy sites such as Google or Wikipedia.

Difficulties envolved with interacting with the counter-intuitive, and in some cases defective, Celery Batches API resulted in more time expended compared to that originally excpected. Fortuneatly it was possible to fix the issues resulting in a defective Batches API and submit those upstream.
