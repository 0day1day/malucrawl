\subsection{Capture-HPC}

Although Capture-HPC is a very capable malware scanning component, there were
numerous difficulties involved setting it up. Compiling the Windows kernel
drivers for the client was a very complex process, but will need to be repeated
to generate installers for other Windows OSs. The ECS specific modifications
that needed two sets of RPC over Message Queues to work also caused considerable
delay to the integration of Capture-HPC into the framework, but means that some
level of network security is maintained separating the hosts running the rest of
the framework from the host running Capture-HPC.
